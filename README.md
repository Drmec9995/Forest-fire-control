# Forest-fire-control

forest, bush or vegetation fire can be describe as any uncontrolled and non-prescribed combustion or burning of plants in a natural setting such as a forest, grassland, etc.
In this project, we are not determining if a forest fire will take place or not, we are *predicting* the confidence of the forest fire based on some attributes


A project on predicting whether it will rain tomorrow or not by using the Rainfall in Australia dataset
This project is tested over lot of ml models like catboost, xgboost, random forest etc.. Out of these models catboost and XGboost performed very well giving an AUC score far better than others.
